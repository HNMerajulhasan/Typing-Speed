                     <p class="card-text fs-5">JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible
                          for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks.
                         <span class="text-info">Before we discuss the event loop, lets first go through the function of the task queue.</span>
                         A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the queue, they 
                         get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then
                          go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out.<br><span class="text-success"><b>Now, The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack 
                          to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers 
                          and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack
                           to be clear again, and repeats the same process.</b></span>
